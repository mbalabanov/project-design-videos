          <h3>iPad Apps That Use the Full Width of an External Display</h3>
          <p>
            The iPad provides support for external screens even without the new
            Stage Manager feature. Usually, it only provides mirroring which
            results in an odd pillar-boxed screen on a wide display. A few apps
            support external screens in their native resolution and wide aspect
            ratio. In this video I demonstrate the Apple Photos app, the Apple
            TV app, the video editing app LumaFusion, the mind mapping app
            MindNode, the muti-window browser app Shiftscreen, and the VNC app
            Edovia Screens with the iPad connected to a Raspberry Pi4.

          <h3>Tier Guided Tours (CraftHack 2022)</h3>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2022, I participated remotely in a hackathon
            organized by CraftHack in Budapest. One of the challenges was to
            produce a concept app for the German micomobility company Tier for
            guided tours on their scooters. In the two days, produced a little
            click-through concept and this video.

          <h3>WIFI Arbeitsauftrag Webdesign und Video</h3>
          <p>
            In this video is in German, I produce the logo, the website and a
            video for the fictional guitar school called "Hifi". I made this for
            a course I visited at the vocational training institute WIFI Wien
            and used the institution's logo as the basis for the Hifi logo. I
            present and narrate the video myself.

          <h3>Wir zeichnen Captain America</h3>
          <p>
            In this video, I draw Captain America in pen and ink while sitting
            in the now defunct coworking space Basis08 the 8th district in
            Vienna. We wanted to use it as one of many promotional videos but
            Basis08 went out of business in 2020 due to COVID19.

          <h3>Chaos Engine: Atari ST and STE</h3>
          <p>
            The game "The Chaos Engine" from the early 1990s by the Bitmap
            Brothers was released for the Commodore Amiga, the Sega MegaDrive
            and other systems. There was also a conversion for the Atari ST
            which famously had a palette of 512 colors, no hardware support for
            sprites and scrolling. On the Ataro STE the Chaos Engine took
            advantage of the extended palette of 4096 and its capability for
            hardware scrolling. This screen recording showcases the differences
            between the regular ST version and the extended STE version.

          <h3>S-Transfer Promotional Video</h3>
          <p>
            I produced this promotional video for S-Transfer, a startup in
            Vienna that sadly went under, that provided a secure and
            GDPR-compliant way of sharing confidential files. The voiceover is
            in German and was provided by a narrator on Fiverr.

          <h3>Veriginal Promotional Video</h3>
          <p>
            Keeping with the theme of startups that went out of business. This
            is a promotional video for a crypto startup in Vienna that tried to
            provide cryptographic evidence that vintage jewelry and expensive
            watches are genuine. Beats me, how they did it, I only made the
            video. The voiceover was provided by a narrator on Fiverr.

          <h3>Reine Stiftsache</h3>
          <p>
            While this is also a promotional video, I did not produce it for a
            failed startup. Rather, this company never existed. I attended an
            online marketing course and we worked on concepts for fictional
            online communities. This is the concept for a community of pen
            aficionados. The video is in German and I narrated the video myself.
